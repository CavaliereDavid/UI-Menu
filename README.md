We run our program using powershell and applying the best practices from: https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle  . 
There are going to be multiple commits in order to keep track of the code being improved. 
1. We started our program by using only params without using cmdLetBinding().
2. We updated the current code and gave It a better structure.
3. Added a try catch block as a scriptblock
4. Added validation method in order to improve readability and avoid redundancy in folder-utils.
5. Updated the Copy-Folder and Create-File to create any file type.
